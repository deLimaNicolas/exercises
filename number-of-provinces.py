    For this solution I want attempt to avoid the O(nË†2) time complexity
    The idea is to use a merge strategy, where I'll merge the parents, so 
    they became the grandparent, this way I just need to count the number of 
    grandparents to know how many comopenents there are.

    So the idea is to compare city by city, so each city will be compared to all its neighbors
    then if there is a connection between these cities I will merge their parents so:

    instead of 1-2-3-4 I'd have 1-2
                                | \
                                4  3
    
    then I just need to check if the city is its own parent, if so I can assure that is 
    a root/parent

    so in a situation like [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]

    I would first create an array that contains each city parent ->
    in this case each city starts being its own parent, but then I will compare each 
    city with all neighbors, and I will also need a rank variable to store the size of each
    component, bc I need to understand which one will be maintained while merging
    and it should be the bigger one

    parents = [0,1,2]
    rank  = [1,1,1]

    the output here should be something like: parents = [0,0,2] -> what is basically 2 
    different values, in other words 2 components

    foreach city:
        is city connected with any neighbor?:
            rank[city] > rank[neighbor]:
                parents[neighbor] = parents[city]
            else if rank[city] < rank[neighbor]:
                parents[city] = parents[neighbor]
            rank[city] += 1
            parents[neighbor] = parents[city]
