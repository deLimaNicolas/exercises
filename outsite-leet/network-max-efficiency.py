PROBLEM: Maximum Network Efficiency
============================================================================

FULL PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Given a network of n computer systems represented as a rooted tree (with the
master computer 1 as the root), the connections between computers are described
using two arrays, connect_from[] and connect_to[]. Each pair (connect_from[i],
connect_to[i]) represents an undirected edge between two computers. Each computer
has a value assigned to it, represented by the array computer_val[].

To maximize the network's throughput, inefficient systems can be removed. In one
operation, any computer node and all nodes in its subtree, can be removed. The
number of such operations applied is denoted as num_ops.

For a given parameter k, the efficiency of the network after num_ops operations is
calculated as: (sum of values of all remaining computer nodes - k * num_ops).

Determine the maximum possible efficiency after applying some (possibly zero)
operations optimally.

Note: The node values can be negative.

Example:
connect_nodes = 4
connect_from = [1, 2, 3]
connect_to = [2, 3, 4]
computer_val = [3, -7, -8, -9]
k = 5

The network can be represented as:
1:3 --- 2:-7 --- 3:-8 --- 4:-9

It is optimal to remove the subtree rooted at node 2. Then,
efficiency = 3 - (1 * 5) = -2, which is the maximum possible.

Hence, the answer is -2.

Function Description:
Complete the function getMaximumEfficiency with the following parameters:
- int connect_nodes: the number of nodes in the system
- int connect_from[connect_nodes - 1]: one node of the connecting edges
- int connect_to[connect_nodes - 1]: the terminal node of the connecting edges
- int computer_val[connect_nodes]: the values of each computer node
- int k: the parameter for calculating efficiency

Returns:
- int: the maximum possible efficiency after applying some operations optimally
